To do

1. ABLine and Contour line UI stuff out of the GL drawing function.
2. Move section lookahead stuff out of GL drawing functinone somehow.
   Maybe after rendering frame, save a pixmap of the entire widget.

For 1 and 2, do we need some way of synchronization so we know for sure
that the data that gets processed in the timer loop has now been rendered?
Does it matter?

3. Should we add Localization resource on the QtAoG? Brian's project has gStr.resx file. 

4. Also, we should talk about method, which is used to passing data to QML from C++.
